# jad-simulator v0.01


There's so much wrong with this project, but I wanna get it posted. It's still sorta usable though. 

Known issues:

- Doesn't work in firefox, there's a layering issue? when hiding/unhiding the video, so changing attacks breaks the page. Works fine in chrome.
- Doesn't actually work fine in chrome, sometimes there's a frame of flickering when changing attacks
- Missing audio for prayer switching
- HP doesn't actually go down upon taking the hit
- I didn't get a version of video without prayer, so I can't have it with prayer turned off
- I am still uncertain of the exact tick timings of attacks, so I had to guess when the cutoff would be for taking the hit
- Damage audio is incorrect
- Background is just black, it's possible to get the entire background if looped perfectly, but that's way out of the scope of this project.
- Audio won't work on chrome until you start clicking buttons, it needs a "start button"
- I set the "You lose" message to replace the score for some reason
- Probably more things I'm just not thinking of

If I decide to continue with this, I'm going to change the jad video to be a single file and jump around in it, as opposed to two that hide and unhide. This was a learning project, and I've learned so much doing it, so I guess it's a win? I'd hate to leave it like this forever, so I'd like to come back to it at some point.
